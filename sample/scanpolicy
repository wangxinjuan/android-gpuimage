Aggregated reporting and campaign data will be stored for up to 14 months. The collection of data can be deactivated in the settings of our barcode scanner apps by unchecking “Usage statistics”.

2.4 - FIREBASE REMOTE CONFIG
We use individual app configurations for our users with the aid of Firebase Remote Config, for example to show country-specific website links. Firebase Remote Config uses Instance IDs to select configuration values to return to end-user devices. These Instance IDs will be stored up to 180 days.
